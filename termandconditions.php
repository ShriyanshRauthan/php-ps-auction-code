            <p>You hereby declare and warrant that You are at least 18 years of age and at least age of majority subject

                not by anyone else. All information that you provide us during the term of validity of this agreement,
                is true, complete, and correct, and that you shall immediately notify us of any change of such
                information.<br>
                You are allowed to have only one account. If you attempt to open more than one account, all accounts you
                try to open may be blocked or closed.<br>
                As part of the registration process you will have to choose your username and password for your login to
                PSAuction.<br>
                During the registration process, you must choose a username, which must not in any way be offensive,
                indecent, insulting or intended to deceive or mislead other users or persons, whether intentionally or
                unintentionally.<br>
                Nor may a user name advertise for or promote any other websites or services, provide links to or for
                other websites.<br>
                Please note that PSAuction reserves the right to change usernames, for whatever reason, and is the final
                arbiter on policy.<br>
                PSAuction will never ask for Your password apart from login. You are solely responsible for Your user
                account password and its preservation. We suggest that you not provide your password to anyone,
                including PSAuction’ employees. User accounts are non-transferable.<br>
                We are not responsible for any abuse or misuse of your account by third parties due to your disclosure,
                whether intentional or accidental, whether active or passive, of your login details to any third party.
            </p>
            <h3>How the Auctions Work</h3>
            <p>With each bid placed, the price of the item on which the user is bidding increases by a small preset
                amount (10 paisa INR to 50 Paisa INR). Each new bid resets the remaining time for an auction up to the
                amount specified for the Auction Type (usually 10, 20, 30, 50, and 60 seconds or up to 10 Minutes as
                specified for that particular auction).<br>
                When a bid is placed, number of credits are deducted from the user’s bidding account as per the
                specified number of credits for that auction. Placed bids are not refundable. An auction closes when no
                more bids are received by PSAuction’ servers. The countdown time is indicated for each auction. Due to
                the time it takes for bids to reach PSAuction’ servers, and in order to allow all users the same
                opportunity to bid regardless of geographic location, PSAuction’ servers will wait for an additional 5
                seconds for any placed bids to reach PSAuction servers before closing the auction.<br>
                The user who was the last to place a bid wins the auction and can purchase the product.<br>
                Bids become valid when they are entered in the PSAuction database and registered in PSAuction’ system.
                PSAuction is not responsible for disruptions in the user’s connection and errors that may occur as a
                result of this. This includes, but is not limited to, incorrect countdown of the remaining time,
                outdated information on bidders, and bids.</p>
            <h3>Account Termination</h3>
            <p>TERMINATION BY YOU :<br>
                You may close your account at any time by sending us notification of your intention.<br>
                TERMINATION BY PSAuction :<br>
                PSAuction reserves the right to temporarily or permanently terminate Your account at its sole discretion
                if it determines You have violated these Terms and Conditions, any laws, or the rights of our other
                users or other third parties. Examples of unauthorized usage include the use of unauthorized third-party
                bidding or bid tracking software, the creation of multiple accounts by the same individual, or if
                PSAuction suspects fraudulent account activity or behavior.<br>
                You agree that if PSAuction, in good faith and in its sole discretion, determines that You have breached
                these Terms and Conditions, PSAuction may withhold, cancel or otherwise retain any and all of Your
                pending deliveries and/or refunds for bids.</p>
            <h3>Applicable Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India.
                Furthermore, these Terms and Conditions shall exclude application of the UN Convention on the
                International Sale of Goods.</p>
